My pseudocode:

Ask user for a list of numbers and a number (k).
Assign list to a list and the number to k.

Take the first number in list and add with second number. Check if sum equals K. If yes, Check is true. If false, repeat with third number until either a sum that equals k is true or at end of list.
If none in list added to first numer equal k, then repeat with second number added to third number and onward.

if none equal, then check returns false.
Output: a message about how none of the numbers added equal k

10-13-2021:
Error: Run-Time Check Failure #2 - Stack around the variable 'numList' was corrupted.

Unsure how to resolve at this time...

Update: I misunderstood array setup/initialization. I had "int numList [4] thinking that would cover 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 
But I should have done "int numList [5] if I wanted 5 spaces so to speak. Also adjusted loops to stop when i or j < 5 instead of 4. 
Seems to be working AND giving accurate results now.

Improvements: 
- Might be good to know if list of numbers should be limited to 5 or allow user to choose how many to enter. 
- Learn how to add unit tests
- Review later with a better understanding of time complexity and how this can be improved
- Have a better understanding of user requirements (should the user be allowed to enter duplicate numbers, negative numbers, decimals, etc?)
