My pseudocode:

Ask user for a list of numbers and a number (k).
Assign list to a list and the number to k.

Take the first number in list and add with second number. Check if sum equals K. If yes, Check is true. If false, repeat with third number until either a sum that equals k is true or at end of list.
If none in list added to first numer equal k, then repeat with second number added to third number and onward.

if none equal, then check returns false.
Output: a message about how none of the numbers added equal k
