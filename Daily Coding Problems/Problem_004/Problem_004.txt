From LeetCode: Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


***********************************************
My Notes:
1. Get input
2. Get character length of integer and initialize an array that same size
3. using a for loop, reassign backwards (assign newNum[0] = input[5], then newNum[1] = input[4])
4. check two arrays and see if they are equal. If not, then false

Could not figure out how to reassign characters in reverse with my method.
